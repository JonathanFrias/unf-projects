Purpose: 
project is to display the usage of semaphores and shared memory.
Details:
This program implements a circular queue, semphores, and shared memory usage
We control the queue via calls to the produce or consume functions which also
handel making modifications to the semphore flags of which there are three.

In addition, we have methods to control inc and dec the semaphores.
They are some assert methods that we used to double check our logic.
the consume and produce function represent the child processes that form the producers and consumers.

Difficulties:
We had issues understanding loading the queue plus the COUNTERS into shared memory but moving the pointer was the fix
Another stupid issue we should have caught was that one consumer was eating all the items. this was do to one of our for loops
statements being incorrect.
Bugs created more bugs and tracking those issues were intresting
Sharing code thanks to Naga's unfimilarity with github's standards
The semaphore stuff was pretty easy thanks to all the support files given to us by Jim Littlton.
