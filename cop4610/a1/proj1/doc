This is project 1, which solves the classic producer/consumer problem.
It creates shared memory as well as semaphores for the forked
child process to communicate.

I had a fun time writing this program. I feel comfortable using C,
but the the semaphores did trip me up a bit.
I think I did something interesting in this program.

I wrote a function, syncronizedAccess, that uses a function pointer,
then calls the function using that function pointer. Not related,
but intersting.

I found that for my program, higher numbers tended to run alot longer.
Not sure if this is due to ineffiecient O(n^2) problems, or if there
is a semaphore bug, however the code does comlete sucessfully for all
tests.
